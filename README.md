# IST411ProjectVideoDiscussionChatRoom
# Project Description
The project that I plan on doing is a youtube collaboration queue project. This project will allow users to watch and queue youtube videos together. There will be commands that will allow users to add a youtube video to the queue, skip a video by majority vote and more. I will also be trying to implement a chatroom with the videos so that people can watch and discuss the videos in real time.

# Checkpoint 3

I have managed to embed a working IRC. I have also added in the function to create a "new room". I have worked on queueing video, the src can take an updated link. At the moment due to my logic, its taking the default link, however, I am able to add on to the link.

For final project, I hope to be able to implement the rest of the use cases.

# I was using Victor's computer to do my code/commit because my computer is acting up. It keeps saying that port 8080 is already in use. I forgot to log out of Victor's github account in netbeans, so thats why the commit is using Victor's acccount.
